Sadly, the assignments and class are in norwegian, and this tends to cause me to write half-norwegian code, so this might not be the most readable code-base for non-norwegians

Languages: Node js

Some criticism welcome i suppose, but these are usually not intended to be anything like perfect.

Each folder is a single assignment.

Node code has package.json:
```
npm install
npm start
